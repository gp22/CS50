/*
Write, in a file called mario.c a program that recreates this half-pyramid
using hashes (#) for blocks. To make things more interesting, first prompt
the user for the half-pyramidâ€™s height, a non-negative integer no greater
than 23. (The height of the half-pyramid pictured above happens to be 8.)
If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23,
you should re-prompt for the same again. Then, generate (with the help of
printf and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. Take care to align
the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your
terminal window.
